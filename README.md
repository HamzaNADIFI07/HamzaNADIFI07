| [**Zombie Defense Game**](https://github.com/HamzaNADIFI07/Zombie-Defense-Game.git)                 | ![JAVA](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=orange)  | This **Java** project involves modeling and developing a defense game against zombie attacks. Inspired by the game Zombicide, it features simplified mechanics to offer a unique experience:<br> - Dynamic construction of a city made up of streets and buildings.<br> - Separate game phases for survivors and zombies, each with specific rules.<br> - Various actions for survivors, such as attacking, searching, or using equipment.<br> - Different types of zombies with unique characteristics and behaviors.<br> The project is designed to be extensible, allowing easy addition of new features. | [DemoJeuZombie](https://github.com/HamzaNADIFI07/HamzaNADIFI07/blob/25453f556142e7dbcb177bcb591b4e3548f0c06a/demoJeuZombie.odt) |
| [**Fruit Collection Game**](https://github.com/HamzaNADIFI07/Fruit-collection-game.git)             | ![NODE.JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js)            | A **Node.js** game project where a character must eat fruits that randomly move within the game area to score points. The player must avoid a monster chasing them: each time the monster touches the player, they lose one life (out of the three initial lives). When the player runs out of lives, they lose the game. The game features simple and dynamic mechanics, with collision management and random movement. | ![DemoJeuFruit](https://github.com/HamzaNADIFI07/HamzaNADIFI07/blob/25453f556142e7dbcb177bcb591b4e3548f0c06a/DemoJeuFruit.jpg) |
| [**Interactive Weather Application**](https://github.com/HamzaNADIFI07/Interactive-Weather-Application.git) | ![REACT](https://img.shields.io/badge/REACT-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=react)                  | An interactive weather application developed with **React.js** that displays meteorological data for different cities (minimum temperature, maximum temperature, rainfall, sunshine, etc.) over the course of a year. The user can select a city and set it as their favorite, then compare its data with other cities. Results are presented in tables and interactive charts, providing a clear visualization of weather differences between cities. | ![DemoMeteo](https://github.com/HamzaNADIFI07/HamzaNADIFI07/blob/25453f556142e7dbcb177bcb591b4e3548f0c06a/DemoMeteo.jpg) |
| [**GameForge: Modular Strategy Board Game**](https://github.com/HamzaNADIFI07/GameForge-Modular-Strategy-Board-Game) | ![JAVA](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=orange)  | This **Java** project focuses on creating a modular strategy board game where players interact with a dynamic board, manage resources, and construct structures depending on the chosen game mode. The game is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing players to explore various strategies through adaptable rules and modular components. | Work in Progress                  |
| [**Portfolio Website**](https://github.com/HamzaNADIFI07/Portfolio-WebSite-React)                  | ![REACT](https://img.shields.io/badge/REACT-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=react)                  | This project focuses on developing an interactive and modern portfolio using **React.js** to showcase my skills, academic background, and projects. The design emphasizes user experience, responsiveness, and a clean, professional presentation. |                  |
